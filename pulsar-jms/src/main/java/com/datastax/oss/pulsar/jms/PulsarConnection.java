   * Creates a {@code Session} object, specifying {@code transacted} and {@code acknowledgeMode}.

   * <p>This method has been superseded by the method {@code createSession(int sessionMode)} which
   * specifies the same information using a single argument, and by the method {@code
   * createSession()} which is for use in a Java EE JTA transaction. Applications should consider
   * using those methods instead of this one.
   *
   * <p>The effect of setting the {@code transacted} and {@code acknowledgeMode} arguments depends
   * on whether this method is called in a Java SE environment, in the Java EE application client
   * container, or in the Java EE web or EJB container. If this method is called in the Java EE web
   * or EJB container then the effect of setting the transacted} and {@code acknowledgeMode}
   * arguments also depends on whether or not there is an active JTA transaction in progress.
   *
   * <p>In a <b>Java SE environment</b> or in <b>the Java EE application client container</b>:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>If {@code transacted} is set to {@code true} then the session will use a local
   *       transaction which may subsequently be committed or rolled back by calling the session's
   *       {@code commit} or {@code rollback} methods. The argument {@code acknowledgeMode} is
   *       ignored.
   *   <li>If {@code transacted} is set to {@code false} then the session will be non-transacted. In
   *       this case the argument {@code acknowledgeMode} is used to specify how messages received
   *       by this session will be acknowledged. The permitted values are {@code
   *       Session.CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE}, {@code Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE} and {@code
   *       Session.DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE}. For a definition of the meaning of these acknowledgement
   *       modes see the links below.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>In a <b>Java EE web or EJB container, when there is an active JTA transaction in
   * progress</b>:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>Both arguments {@code transacted} and {@code acknowledgeMode} are ignored. The session
   *       will participate in the JTA transaction and will be committed or rolled back when that
   *       transaction is committed or rolled back, not by calling the session's {@code commit} or
   *       {@code rollback} methods. Since both arguments are ignored, developers are recommended to

   *       be non-transacted and messages will be acknowledged according to the value of {@code
   *       acknowledgeMode}.
   *   <li>If {@code transacted} is set to false and {@code acknowledgeMode} is set to {@code
   *       JMSContext.CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE} then the JMS provider is recommended to ignore the
   *       specified parameters and instead provide a non-transacted, auto-acknowledged session.
   *       However the JMS provider may alternatively provide a non-transacted session with client
   *       acknowledgement.
   *   <li>If {@code transacted} is set to true, then the JMS provider is recommended to ignore the
   *       specified parameters and instead provide a non-transacted, auto-acknowledged session.
   *       However the JMS provider may alternatively provide a local transacted session.
   *   <li>Applications are recommended to set {@code transacted} to false and {@code
   *       acknowledgeMode} to {@code JMSContext.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE} or {@code
   *       Session.DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE} since since applications which set {@code transacted} to
   *       false and set {@code acknowledgeMode} to {@code JMSContext.CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE}, or which
   *       set {@code transacted} to true, may not be portable.

  /**
   * Closes the connection.
   *
   * <p>Since a provider typically allocates significant resources outside the JVM on behalf of a
   * connection, clients should close these resources when they are not needed. Relying on garbage
   * collection to eventually reclaim these resources may not be timely enough.
   *
   * <p>There is no need to close the sessions, producers, and consumers of a closed connection.
   *
   * <p>Closing a connection causes all temporary destinations to be deleted.
   *
   * <p>When this method is invoked, it should not return until message processing has been shut
   * down in an orderly fashion. This means that all message listeners that may have been running
   * have returned, and that all pending receives have returned.
   *
   * <p>However if the close method is called from a message listener on its own connection, then it
   * will either fail and throw a {@code javax.jms.IllegalStateException}, or it will succeed and
   * close the connection, blocking until all other message listeners that may have been running
   * have returned, and all pending receive calls have completed. If close succeeds and the
   * acknowledge mode of the session is set to {@code AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE}, the current message will
   * still be acknowledged automatically when the {@code onMessage} call completes. Since two
   * alternative behaviors are permitted in this case, applications should avoid calling close from
   * a message listener on its own connection because this is not portable.
   *
   * <p>A close terminates all pending message receives on the connection's sessions' consumers. The
   * receives may return with a message or with null, depending on whether there was a message
   * available at the time of the close. If one or more of the connection's sessions' message
   * listeners is processing a message at the time when connection {@code close} is invoked, all the
   * facilities of the connection and its sessions must remain available to those listeners until
   * they return control to the JMS provider.
   *
   * <p>This method must not return until any incomplete asynchronous send operations for this
   * <tt>Connection</tt> have been completed and any <tt>CompletionListener</tt> callbacks have
   * returned. Incomplete sends should be allowed to complete normally unless an error occurs.
   *
   * <p>For the avoidance of doubt, if an exception listener for this connection is running when
   * {@code close} is invoked, there is no requirement for the {@code close} call to wait until the
   * exception listener has returned before it may return.
   *
   * <p>Closing a connection causes any of its sessions' transactions in progress to be rolled back.
   * In the case where a session's work is coordinated by an external transaction manager, a
   * session's {@code commit} and {@code rollback} methods are not used and the result of a closed
   * session's work is determined later by the transaction manager. Closing a connection does NOT
   * force an acknowledgment of client-acknowledged sessions.
   *
   * <p>A <tt>CompletionListener</tt> callback method must not call <tt>close</tt> on its own
   * <tt>Connection</tt>. Doing so will cause an <tt>IllegalStateException</tt> to be thrown.
   *
   * <p>Invoking the {@code acknowledge} method of a received message from a closed connection's
   * session must throw an {@code IllegalStateException}. Closing a closed connection must NOT throw
   * an exception.
   *
   * @throws IllegalStateException
   *     <ul>
   *       <li>this method has been called by a <tt>MessageListener </tt> on its own

   *       <li>this method has been called by a <tt>CompletionListener</tt> callback method on its
   *           own <tt>Connection</tt>
   *     </ul>
   *
   * @throws JMSException if the JMS provider fails to close the connection due to some internal
   *     error. For example, a failure to release resources or to close a socket connection can
   *     cause this exception to be thrown.
