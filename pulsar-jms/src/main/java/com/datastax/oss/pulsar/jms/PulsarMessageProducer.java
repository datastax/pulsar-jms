  /**
   * Sends a message using the {@code MessageProducer}'s default delivery mode, priority, and time
   * to live, performing part of the work involved in sending the message in a separate thread and
   * notifying the specified <tt>CompletionListener</tt> when the operation has completed. JMS
   * refers to this as an "asynchronous send".
   *
   * <p>When the message has been successfully sent the JMS provider invokes the callback method
   * <tt>onCompletion</tt> on an application-specified <tt>CompletionListener</tt> object. Only when
   * that callback has been invoked can the application be sure that the message has been
   * successfully sent with the same degree of confidence as if a normal synchronous send had been
   * performed. An application which requires this degree of confidence must therefore wait for the
   * callback to be invoked before continuing.
   *
   * <p>The following information is intended to give an indication of how an asynchronous send
   * would typically be implemented.
   *
   * <p>In some JMS providers, a normal synchronous send involves sending the message to a remote
   * JMS server and then waiting for an acknowledgement to be received before returning. It is
   * expected that such a provider would implement an asynchronous send by sending the message to
   * the remote JMS server and then returning without waiting for an acknowledgement. When the
   * acknowledgement is received, the JMS provider would notify the application by invoking the
   * <tt>onCompletion</tt> method on the application-specified <tt>CompletionListener</tt> object.
   * If for some reason the acknowledgement is not received the JMS provider would notify the
   * application by invoking the <tt>CompletionListener</tt>'s <tt>onException</tt> method.
   *
   * <p>In those cases where the JMS specification permits a lower level of reliability, a normal
   * synchronous send might not wait for an acknowledgement. In that case it is expected that an
   * asynchronous send would be similar to a synchronous send: the JMS provider would send the
   * message to the remote JMS server and then return without waiting for an acknowledgement.
   * However the JMS provider would still notify the application that the send had completed by
   * invoking the <tt>onCompletion</tt> method on the application-specified
   * <tt>CompletionListener</tt> object.
   *
   * <p>It is up to the JMS provider to decide exactly what is performed in the calling thread and
   * what, if anything, is performed asynchronously, so long as it satisfies the requirements given
   * below:
   *
   * <p><b>Quality of service</b>: After the send operation has completed successfully, which means
   * that the message has been successfully sent with the same degree of confidence as if a normal
   * synchronous send had been performed, the JMS provider must invoke the
   * <tt>CompletionListener</tt>'s <tt>onCompletion</tt> method. The <tt>CompletionListener</tt>
   * must not be invoked earlier than this.
   *
   * <p><b>Exceptions</b>: If an exception is encountered during the call to the <tt>send</tt>
   * method then an appropriate exception should be thrown in the thread that is calling the
   * <tt>send</tt> method. In this case the JMS provider must not invoke the
   * <tt>CompletionListener</tt>'s <tt>onCompletion</tt> or <tt>onException</tt> method. If an
   * exception is encountered which cannot be thrown in the thread that is calling the <tt>send</tt>
   * method then the JMS provider must call the <tt>CompletionListener</tt>'s <tt>onException</tt>
   * method. In both cases if an exception occurs it is undefined whether or not the message was
   * successfully sent.
   *
   * <p><b>Message order</b>: If the same <tt>MessageProducer</tt> is used to send multiple messages
   * then JMS message ordering requirements must be satisfied. This applies even if a combination of
   * synchronous and asynchronous sends has been performed. The application is not required to wait
   * for an asynchronous send to complete before sending the next message.
   *
   * <p><b>Close, commit or rollback</b>: If the <tt>close</tt> method is called on the
   * <tt>MessageProducer</tt> or its <tt>Session</tt> or <tt>Connection</tt> then the JMS provider
   * must block until any incomplete send operations have been completed and all {@code
   * CompletionListener} callbacks have returned before closing the object and returning. If the
   * session is transacted (uses a local transaction) then when the <tt>Session</tt>'s
   * <tt>commit</tt> or <tt>rollback</tt> method is called the JMS provider must block until any
   * incomplete send operations have been completed and all {@code CompletionListener} callbacks
   * have returned before performing the commit or rollback. Incomplete sends should be allowed to
   * complete normally unless an error occurs.
   *
   * <p>A <tt>CompletionListener</tt> callback method must not call <tt>close</tt> on its own
   * <tt>Connection</tt>, <tt>Session</tt> or <tt>MessageProducer</tt> or call <tt>commit</tt> or
   * <tt>rollback</tt> on its own <tt>Session</tt>. Doing so will cause the <tt>close</tt>,
   * <tt>commit</tt> or <tt>rollback</tt> to throw an <tt>IllegalStateException</tt>.
   *
   * <p><b>Restrictions on usage in Java EE</b> This method must not be used in a Java EE EJB or web
   * container. Doing so may cause a {@code JMSException} to be thrown though this is not
   * guaranteed.
   *
   * <p><b>Message headers</b> JMS defines a number of message header fields and message properties
   * which must be set by the "JMS provider on send". If the send is asynchronous these fields and
   * properties may be accessed on the sending client only after the <tt>CompletionListener</tt> has
   * been invoked. If the <tt>CompletionListener</tt>'s <tt>onException</tt> method is called then
   * the state of these message header fields and properties is undefined.
   *
   * <p><b>Restrictions on threading</b>: Applications that perform an asynchronous send must
   * confirm to the threading restrictions defined in JMS. This means that the session may be used
   * by only one thread at a time.
   *
   * <p>Setting a <tt>CompletionListener</tt> does not cause the session to be dedicated to the
   * thread of control which calls the <tt>CompletionListener</tt>. The application thread may
   * therefore continue to use the session after performing an asynchronous send. However the
   * <tt>CompletionListener</tt>'s callback methods must not use the session if an application
   * thread might be using the session at the same time.
   *
   * <p><b>Use of the <tt>CompletionListener</tt> by the JMS provider</b>: A session will only
   * invoke one <tt>CompletionListener</tt> callback method at a time. For a given
   * <tt>MessageProducer</tt>, callbacks (both {@code onCompletion} and {@code onException}) will be
   * performed in the same order as the corresponding calls to the asynchronous send method. A JMS
   * provider must not invoke the <tt>CompletionListener</tt> from the thread that is calling the
   * asynchronous <tt>send</tt> method.
   *
   * <p><b>Restrictions on the use of the Message object</b>: Applications which perform an
   * asynchronous send must take account of the restriction that a <tt>Message</tt> object is
   * designed to be accessed by one logical thread of control at a time and does not support
   * concurrent use.
   *
   * <p>After the <tt>send</tt> method has returned, the application must not attempt to read the
   * headers, properties or body of the <tt>Message</tt> object until the
   * <tt>CompletionListener</tt>'s <tt>onCompletion</tt> or <tt>onException</tt> method has been
   * called. This is because the JMS provider may be modifying the <tt>Message</tt> object in
   * another thread during this time. The JMS provider may throw an <tt>JMSException</tt> if the
   * application attempts to access or modify the <tt>Message</tt> object after the <tt>send</tt>
   * method has returned and before the <tt>CompletionListener</tt> has been invoked. If the JMS
   * provider does not throw an exception then the behaviour is undefined.
   *
   * @param message the message to send
   * @param completionListener a {@code CompletionListener} to be notified when the send has
   *     completed
   * @throws JMSException if an internal error occurs
   * @throws MessageFormatException if an invalid message is specified.

  /**
   * Sends a message, specifying delivery mode, priority and time to live, performing part of the
   * work involved in sending the message in a separate thread and notifying the specified
   * <tt>CompletionListener</tt> when the operation has completed. JMS refers to this as an
   * "asynchronous send".
   *
   * <p>When the message has been successfully sent the JMS provider invokes the callback method
   * <tt>onCompletion</tt> on an application-specified <tt>CompletionListener</tt> object. Only when
   * that callback has been invoked can the application be sure that the message has been
   * successfully sent with the same degree of confidence as if a normal synchronous send had been
   * performed. An application which requires this degree of confidence must therefore wait for the
   * callback to be invoked before continuing.
   *
   * <p>The following information is intended to give an indication of how an asynchronous send
   * would typically be implemented.
   *
   * <p>In some JMS providers, a normal synchronous send involves sending the message to a remote
   * JMS server and then waiting for an acknowledgement to be received before returning. It is
   * expected that such a provider would implement an asynchronous send by sending the message to
   * the remote JMS server and then returning without waiting for an acknowledgement. When the
   * acknowledgement is received, the JMS provider would notify the application by invoking the
   * <tt>onCompletion</tt> method on the application-specified <tt>CompletionListener</tt> object.
   * If for some reason the acknowledgement is not received the JMS provider would notify the
   * application by invoking the <tt>CompletionListener</tt>'s <tt>onException</tt> method.
   *
   * <p>In those cases where the JMS specification permits a lower level of reliability, a normal
   * synchronous send might not wait for an acknowledgement. In that case it is expected that an
   * asynchronous send would be similar to a synchronous send: the JMS provider would send the
   * message to the remote JMS server and then return without waiting for an acknowledgement.
   * However the JMS provider would still notify the application that the send had completed by
   * invoking the <tt>onCompletion</tt> method on the application-specified
   * <tt>CompletionListener</tt> object.
   *
   * <p>It is up to the JMS provider to decide exactly what is performed in the calling thread and
   * what, if anything, is performed asynchronously, so long as it satisfies the requirements given
   * below:
   *
   * <p><b>Quality of service</b>: After the send operation has completed successfully, which means
   * that the message has been successfully sent with the same degree of confidence as if a normal
   * synchronous send had been performed, the JMS provider must invoke the
   * <tt>CompletionListener</tt>'s <tt>onCompletion</tt> method. The <tt>CompletionListener</tt>
   * must not be invoked earlier than this.
   *
   * <p><b>Exceptions</b>: If an exception is encountered during the call to the <tt>send</tt>
   * method then an appropriate exception should be thrown in the thread that is calling the
   * <tt>send</tt> method. In this case the JMS provider must not invoke the
   * <tt>CompletionListener</tt>'s <tt>onCompletion</tt> or <tt>onException</tt> method. If an
   * exception is encountered which cannot be thrown in the thread that is calling the <tt>send</tt>
   * method then the JMS provider must call the <tt>CompletionListener</tt>'s <tt>onException</tt>
   * method. In both cases if an exception occurs it is undefined whether or not the message was
   * successfully sent.
   *
   * <p><b>Message order</b>: If the same <tt>MessageProducer</tt> is used to send multiple messages
   * then JMS message ordering requirements must be satisfied. This applies even if a combination of
   * synchronous and asynchronous sends has been performed. The application is not required to wait
   * for an asynchronous send to complete before sending the next message.
   *
   * <p><b>Close, commit or rollback</b>: If the <tt>close</tt> method is called on the
   * <tt>MessageProducer</tt> or its <tt>Session</tt> or <tt>Connection</tt> then the JMS provider
   * must block until any incomplete send operations have been completed and all {@code
   * CompletionListener} callbacks have returned before closing the object and returning. If the
   * session is transacted (uses a local transaction) then when the <tt>Session</tt>'s
   * <tt>commit</tt> or <tt>rollback</tt> method is called the JMS provider must block until any
   * incomplete send operations have been completed and all {@code CompletionListener} callbacks
   * have returned before performing the commit or rollback. Incomplete sends should be allowed to
   * complete normally unless an error occurs.
   *
   * <p>A <tt>CompletionListener</tt> callback method must not call <tt>close</tt> on its own
   * <tt>Connection</tt>, <tt>Session</tt> or <tt>MessageProducer</tt> or call <tt>commit</tt> or
   * <tt>rollback</tt> on its own <tt>Session</tt>. Doing so will cause the <tt>close</tt>,
   * <tt>commit</tt> or <tt>rollback</tt> to throw an <tt>IllegalStateException</tt>.
   *
   * <p><b>Restrictions on usage in Java EE</b> This method must not be used in a Java EE EJB or web
   * container. Doing so may cause a {@code JMSException} to be thrown though this is not
   * guaranteed.
   *
   * <p><b>Message headers</b> JMS defines a number of message header fields and message properties
   * which must be set by the "JMS provider on send". If the send is asynchronous these fields and
   * properties may be accessed on the sending client only after the <tt>CompletionListener</tt> has
   * been invoked. If the <tt>CompletionListener</tt>'s <tt>onException</tt> method is called then
   * the state of these message header fields and properties is undefined.
   *
   * <p><b>Restrictions on threading</b>: Applications that perform an asynchronous send must
   * confirm to the threading restrictions defined in JMS. This means that the session may be used
   * by only one thread at a time.
   *
   * <p>Setting a <tt>CompletionListener</tt> does not cause the session to be dedicated to the
   * thread of control which calls the <tt>CompletionListener</tt>. The application thread may
   * therefore continue to use the session after performing an asynchronous send. However the
   * <tt>CompletionListener</tt>'s callback methods must not use the session if an application
   * thread might be using the session at the same time.
   *
   * <p><b>Use of the <tt>CompletionListener</tt> by the JMS provider</b>: A session will only
   * invoke one <tt>CompletionListener</tt> callback method at a time. For a given
   * <tt>MessageProducer</tt>, callbacks (both {@code onCompletion} and {@code onException}) will be
   * performed in the same order as the corresponding calls to the asynchronous send method. A JMS
   * provider must not invoke the <tt>CompletionListener</tt> from the thread that is calling the
   * asynchronous <tt>send</tt> method.
   *
   * <p><b>Restrictions on the use of the Message object</b>: Applications which perform an
   * asynchronous send must take account of the restriction that a <tt>Message</tt> object is
   * designed to be accessed by one logical thread of control at a time and does not support
   * concurrent use.
   *
   * <p>After the <tt>send</tt> method has returned, the application must not attempt to read the
   * headers, properties or body of the <tt>Message</tt> object until the
   * <tt>CompletionListener</tt>'s <tt>onCompletion</tt> or <tt>onException</tt> method has been
   * called. This is because the JMS provider may be modifying the <tt>Message</tt> object in
   * another thread during this time. The JMS provider may throw an <tt>JMSException</tt> if the
   * application attempts to access or modify the <tt>Message</tt> object after the <tt>send</tt>
   * method has returned and before the <tt>CompletionListener</tt> has been invoked. If the JMS
   * provider does not throw an exception then the behaviour is undefined.

   * <tt>commit</tt> or <tt>rollback</tt> method is called the JMS provider must block until any
   * incomplete send operations have been completed and all {@code CompletionListener} callbacks
   * have returned before performing the commit or rollback. Incomplete sends should be allowed to
   * complete normally unless an error occurs.
   *
   * <p>A <tt>CompletionListener</tt> callback method must not call <tt>close</tt> on its own
   * <tt>Connection</tt>, <tt>Session</tt> or <tt>MessageProducer</tt> or call <tt>commit</tt> or
   * <tt>rollback</tt> on its own <tt>Session</tt>. Doing so will cause the <tt>close</tt>,
   * <tt>commit</tt> or <tt>rollback</tt> to throw an <tt>IllegalStateException</tt>.
   *
   * <p><b>Restrictions on usage in Java EE</b> This method must not be used in a Java EE EJB or web
   * container. Doing so may cause a {@code JMSException} to be thrown though this is not
   * guaranteed.
   *
   * <p><b>Message headers</b> JMS defines a number of message header fields and message properties
   * which must be set by the "JMS provider on send". If the send is asynchronous these fields and
   * properties may be accessed on the sending client only after the <tt>CompletionListener</tt> has
   * been invoked. If the <tt>CompletionListener</tt>'s <tt>onException</tt> method is called then
   * the state of these message header fields and properties is undefined.
   *
   * <p><b>Restrictions on threading</b>: Applications that perform an asynchronous send must
   * confirm to the threading restrictions defined in JMS. This means that the session may be used
   * by only one thread at a time.
   *
   * <p>Setting a <tt>CompletionListener</tt> does not cause the session to be dedicated to the
   * thread of control which calls the <tt>CompletionListener</tt>. The application thread may
   * therefore continue to use the session after performing an asynchronous send. However the
   * <tt>CompletionListener</tt>'s callback methods must not use the session if an application
   * thread might be using the session at the same time.
   *
   * <p><b>Use of the <tt>CompletionListener</tt> by the JMS provider</b>: A session will only
   * invoke one <tt>CompletionListener</tt> callback method at a time. For a given
   * <tt>MessageProducer</tt>, callbacks (both {@code onCompletion} and {@code onException}) will be
   * performed in the same order as the corresponding calls to the asynchronous send method. A JMS
   * provider must not invoke the <tt>CompletionListener</tt> from the thread that is calling the
   * asynchronous <tt>send</tt> method.
   *
   * <p><b>Restrictions on the use of the Message object</b>: Applications which perform an
   * asynchronous send must take account of the restriction that a <tt>Message</tt> object is
   * designed to be accessed by one logical thread of control at a time and does not support
   * concurrent use.
   *
   * <p>After the <tt>send</tt> method has returned, the application must not attempt to read the
   * headers, properties or body of the <tt>Message</tt> object until the
   * <tt>CompletionListener</tt>'s <tt>onCompletion</tt> or <tt>onException</tt> method has been
   * called. This is because the JMS provider may be modifying the <tt>Message</tt> object in
   * another thread during this time. The JMS provider may throw an <tt>JMSException</tt> if the
   * application attempts to access or modify the <tt>Message</tt> object after the <tt>send</tt>
   * method has returned and before the <tt>CompletionListener</tt> has been invoked. If the JMS
   * provider does not throw an exception then the behaviour is undefined.
